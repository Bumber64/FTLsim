FTL Simulation
Demonstrates visibility of a ship using a warp drive.

Ship moves at 4 lightyears/year
Ship travels from Star A to B to C, then back to A
Ship rests 5 years after arriving at a star
Stars are 40 lightyears apart
Time advances in 1 year increments
Distance is measured along X-axis from origin at Star A
Photons move at 1 lightyear/year
Photons indicate where they're from via distance from A
Photons are spawned higher on the y-axis over time for visibility
When a photon is over a star, that star sees the ship as though it were at the indicated location.

Controls:
Right Arrow = Advance time forward
Left Arrow = Advance time backward
